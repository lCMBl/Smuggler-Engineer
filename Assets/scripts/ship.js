// Stores the state of ship systems, and the progress with hyperspace calculations.
// Ship can continue calculations as long as the computer is working, but if the critical systems,
// (for now, the engine and computer) aren't working, then the ship won't jump until they are fixed)
// jumping requires pressing the "jump to lightspeed button" (does not automatically jump)
